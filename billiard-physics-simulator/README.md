# Billiard Physics Simulator

Welcome to the Billiard Physics Simulator! This project is designed to demonstrate the principles of physics and trigonometry through an interactive billiard game. It allows users to explore concepts such as ball collisions, trajectories, and the effects of spin and speed on gameplay.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: Experience accurate ball movement and collision responses based on physics principles.
- **Mouse-Controlled Cue Ball Movement**: Control the cue ball's position and angle using your mouse.
- **Adjustable Game Settings**: Modify speed, spin, and the number of balls in play through an intuitive user interface.
- **Cue Stick Trajectory Indicator**: Visualize the trajectory of the cue ball before making a shot.
- **Masse and Jump Shots**: Execute advanced shots like masse and jump with the cue ball.
